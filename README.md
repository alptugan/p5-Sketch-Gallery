# Creative Coding Class Showcase

A gallery for p5.js sketches built with vanilla JavaScript, custom web components, and Vite. Built for my Creative Coding class students to showcase their p5.js projects. Users can view sketches in a responsive layout, and an admin panel allows for easy management of the sketches using the links of their p5js editor or openProcessing. 

## How it works
- Copy the browser link of your p5.js sketch from the p5.js web editor or openProcessing.
- Go to the admin panel (http://localhost:3000/admin.html) and log in with the admin credentials (.env file).
- Use the "Add Sketch" form to paste your sketch link, provide a title and description, canvas size and submit.
- The sketch will be added to the gallery and can be viewed by all users.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Web Components
- **Styling**: CSS with CSS custom properties (variables)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Dev Server**: Nodemon for auto-restart

## Run locally

- Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```

- Start the app (backend + static frontend):
    ```sh
    pnpm start
    ```
    - Opens an Express server on http://localhost:3000
    - The frontend is served as static files from [index.html](index.html)
    - Imports [`src/config.js`](src/config.js) generated by the backend

- Open the gallery:
    - http://localhost:3000/

## Admin panel (Headless UI)

- URL: http://localhost:3000/admin.html
- Features: add/remove/edit sketches; persists to [`data/sketches.json`](data/sketches.json); regenerates [`src/config.js`](src/config.js)
- Built with React (JSX) and Vite
- Development (with Vite HMR):
    ```sh
    pnpm dev
    ```
    - Express at http://localhost:3000
    - Vite (admin UI) at http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api to Express)
    - Visit admin during dev via Vite: http://localhost:5173/admin-dist/

- Production build:
    ```sh
    pnpm build:admin
    ```
    - Outputs to [`admin-dist/`](admin-dist/)
    - Start server normally: `pnpm start`
    - Express serves `/admin-dist` and routes `/admin.html` to the built admin

## Project Structure

- [`src/main.js`](src/main.js) - Main app component using Web Components
- [`src/styles.css`](src/styles.css) - Custom CSS with animations and responsive layout
- [`src/reset.css`](src/reset.css) - CSS reset for consistent styling
- [`src/config.js`](src/config.js) - Generated sketch configuration (from backend)
- [`server.js`](server.js) - Express backend with API endpoints
- [`vite.config.js`](vite.config.js) - Vite configuration for admin panel

## Deployment (Railway.app)

This project is configured for Railway deployment with automatic builds.

### Setup:

1. **Connect your GitHub repository** to Railway
2. **Set environment variables** (optional):
   - `ADMIN_USER` - Username for admin authentication
   - `ADMIN_PASS` - Password for admin authentication
   - `PORT` - Auto-set by Railway (default: 3000)

3. **Deploy settings**:
   - Build Command: `pnpm install && pnpm build`
   - Start Command: `pnpm start`
   - The build process automatically:
     - Builds the admin UI (`admin-dist/`)
     - Generates `src/config.js` from `data/sketches.json`

### Important files for deployment:
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
- `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration (uses Node.js 20 + pnpm)
- `.gitignore` - Excludes `admin-dist/` (generated during build)

### After deployment:
- Gallery: `https://your-app.railway.app/`
- Admin Panel: `https://your-app.railway.app/admin.html`
